Aim To analyze protein and DNA sequences using bioinformatics tools for functional annotation, structural prediction, and evolutionary relationship determination through phylogenetic tree construction. 2. Learning Outcomes - Retrieve DNA and protein sequences from databases (NCBI, UniProt) - Perform sequence similarity searches (BLASTn, BLASTp) - Align sequences using Clustal Omega or MUSCLE - Predict domains, motifs, and protein properties - Model protein 3D structures using SWISS-MODEL or AlphaFold - Construct and interpret phylogenetic trees (MEGA X / Phylogeny.fr) 3. Requirements - Internet access and computer with browser - Tools: NCBI BLAST, Clustal Omega, InterPro, ProtParam, SWISS"

Procedure Step 1: Sequence Retrieval Retrieve DNA sequence () and protein sequence () from NCBI or UniProt. Save in FASTA format. Step 2: Similarity Search Run BLASTn for DNA and BLASTp for protein. Record top hits with % identity, coverage, E-value, and function. Step 3: Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) Align selected sequences using Clustal Omega or MUSCLE. Highlight conserved regions. Step 4: Functional Analysis Use InterPro/Pfam to identify protein motifs and domains. Use ProtParam for protein properties."

    "text": "- Protein structure model - Phylogenetic tree 6. Conclusion This analysis investigated the protein sequence AAA52061.1 , the cytochrome c oxidase precursor from Homo sapiens . A BLASTp search confirmed its identity, revealing high similarity to cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5B proteins in other mammals, including the orangutan ( Pongo pygmaeus ). Functional analysis using InterPro identified a key \"Cytochrome c oxidase subunit Vb, copper-binding domain,\" confirming its role in cellular respiration. Physicochemical analysis via ProtParam determined the protein has a molecular weight of approximately 13.7 kDa and is classified as unstable. A 3D structural model was obtained from the AlphaFold database. Finally, a multiple sequence alignment showed high conservation across related species, and"

Finally, a multiple sequence alignment showed high conservation across related species, and the phylogenetic tree constructed using MEGA X demonstrated evolutionary relationships consistent with known biology, grouping Homo sapiens most closely with Pongo pygmaeus . In summary, this series of bioinformatic analyses successfully characterized the protein's function, physicochemical properties, structure, and evolutionary context."
