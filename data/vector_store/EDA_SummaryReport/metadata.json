    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Summary Report 1. Introduction The purpose of this report is to perform a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Delinquency Prediction Dataset to uncover early indicators of financial risk and identify variables most predictive of account delinquency. The goal is to understand the data quality, variable relationships, and behavioral or financial patterns that influence delinquency outcomes. This analysis aims to guide the development of a predictive model that can help financial institutions proactively detect at-risk customers, improve credit risk management, and enhance decision-making through data-driven insights. 2. Dataset Overview This dataset contains 500 records representing individual customer financial data and credit behavior. Key d"

    "text": "Justification: Median imputation helps preserve the data’s central tendency without being skewed by extreme values, maintaining dataset stability for downstream model training. 4. Key Findings and Risk Indicators Correlations observed between key variables: ● Higher Credit_Utilization is positively correlated with Missed_Payments and Delinquent_Account , indicating that overused credit lines increase delinquency risk. ● Low Credit_Score strongly associates with higher Missed_Payments and greater Loan_Balance , confirming its reliability as a risk indicator. ● Debt_to_Income_Ratio above 0.4 often aligns with delinquency cases, suggesting over-leveraging behavior. ● Employment_Status : Unemployed individuals show a higher proportion of delinquent accounts. Unexpected anomalies: ● A few custo"

Unexpected anomalies: ● A few customers had Credit_Utilization > 1.0 , suggesting potential data entry or reporting errors. ● Some accounts showed zero Missed_Payments but low Credit_Score , possibly indicating legacy credit issues not captured in recent months. 5. AI & GenAI Usage Generative AI tools were utilized to accelerate the EDA process by identifying relationships, summarizing dataset statistics, and recommending data treatment strategies. Example AI prompts used: ● “Summarize key patterns in the dataset and identify anomalies.”"

Conclusion & Next Steps Summary of key findings: ● Approximately 16% of customers are delinquent, often linked with low credit scores , high utilization , and high debt-to-income ratios . ● Income and Loan_Balance imputation are necessary preprocessing steps. ● Employment_Status and Credit_Utilization are strong categorical and numerical predictors respectively. Next Steps: 1. Perform feature scaling and encoding for model readiness. 2. Apply correlation-based feature selection or SHAP analysis to identify top predictors. 3."

Develop baseline models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest). 4. Monitor fairness and bias (e.g., by location or employment type). 5. Validate model using stratified cross-validation to ensure balanced delinquency representation."
