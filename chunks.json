  "Business Summary Report: Predictive Insights for Collections Strategy 1. Summary of Predictive Insights Our delinquency prediction model for Geldium revealed clear and actionable risk patterns that can help the Collections team target interventions more precisely. Using logistic regression with fairness and interpretability in mind, the analysis identified credit utilization , payment history , and debt-to-income ratio (DTI) as the strongest predictors of customer delinquency. Key insights for the Collections Strategy: ● Customers with credit utilization ≥80% are over 3x more likely to default in the next payment cycle. ● Two or more missed paymen",
  "ers with credit utilization ≥80% are over 3x more likely to default in the next payment cycle. ● Two or more missed payments combined with DTI > 0.5 strongly increases delinquency probability. ● Younger borrowers (age 25–35) and customers with multiple small loans show higher delinquency risk due to financial instability. Key Insights Summary Table Key Insight Customer Segment Influencing Variables Potential Impact Customers with ≥80% credit utilization are 3x more likely to default Over-leveraged credit users Credit Utilization, DTI, Recent Missed Payments Early engagement could reduce delinquency by ~25–30% Two or more missed payments predict chronic delinquency",
  "cent Missed Payments Early engagement could reduce delinquency by ~25–30% Two or more missed payments predict chronic delinquency Customers with repeated late payments Payment History, Loan Amount, Tenure Enables proactive outreach before default stage",
  "Younger borrowers with limited income show higher risk Age 25–35 segment with moderate loans Age, Income, Utilization Rate Early education and personalized repayment options can improve retention 2. Recommendation Framework Restated Insight: Customers with credit utilization ≥80% are significantly more likely to default within the next billing cycle, especially when combined with a DTI ratio above 0.5 . Proposed Recommendation: Pilot a 6-week proactive financial engagement campaign targeting high-utilization customers, aiming to reduce 30+ day delinquency by 20% within 6 months. Specific: Launch an automated alert and financial counseling program for customers wi",
  "ay delinquency by 20% within 6 months. Specific: Launch an automated alert and financial counseling program for customers with ≥80% credit utilization. The system will send reminders, offer repayment options, and provide links to budget planning tools. Measurable: Track reduction in 30+ day delinquency within this group (target: 20% decrease ) and measure engagement rate with outreach messages (>50% response rate). Actionable: Use Geldium’s existing CRM and customer communication tools (email/SMS) to deliver alerts and track repayment activity — no major new infrastructure needed. Relevant: Aligns with Geldium’s business goals of reducing bad debt",

Ethical and Responsible AI Considerations Fairness and Bias Concerns ● Risk 1: Income-based bias — Customers with lower income naturally have higher credit utilization and might be unfairly labeled “high-risk.” Mitigation: Apply fai",
  "h lower income naturally have higher credit utilization and might be unfairly labeled “high-risk.” Mitigation: Apply fairness checks by income level, use proportional utilization",
  "metrics (relative to credit limits), and avoid punitive actions. ● Risk 2: Age-based bias — Younger borrowers may appear riskier due to shorter credit histories. Mitigation: Incorporate behavioral variables (e.g., payment consistency) over demographic ones, ensuring decisions are performance-based, not age-based. Explainability The chosen logistic regression model is transparent and interpretable , allowing us to explain predictions in clear terms: “The model flags a customer as high-risk when credit utilization is above 80% and two or more payments are missed in the past quarter.” This language is easily understood by both technical and non-technical st",
  "r more payments are missed in the past quarter.” This language is easily understood by both technical and non-technical stakeholders, including the Head of Collections and customer service teams. Responsible and Transparent AI Use ● Transparency: All predictive insights are traceable and interpretable; no black-box algorithms are used. ● Accountability: Regular model audits and fairness reviews ensure compliance with Geldium’s ethical AI framework. ● Customer Impact: The recommendations focus on supporting customers through education and flexible repayment — not penalizing them. ● Data Privacy: All personal and financial data are anonymized during analysis",
